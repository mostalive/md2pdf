# Md2Pdf

This gem lets you create a nicely formatted document from a markdown
source.

Primarily we created this gem to enable us to quickly write markdown
documents for offers for clients without worrying about layout and
formatting and while being able to use a light weight text editor like
vim, emacs, gedit, notepad whatever.

We have worked with markdown in combination with pandoc with a latex
template for pdf creation and pdftk for adding a background for each
page (like a kind of printed template page with a logo and address
footer.

We found ourselves copying and pasting a simple rakefile, templates and logos
everywhere we needed to create an offer or similar document.
